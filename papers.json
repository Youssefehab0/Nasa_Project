    "summary": "This study investigated how the absence of caveolae (small membrane invaginations) affects lymphatic fluid transport in mice. Mice lacking the caveolin-1 protein (and thus caveolae) showed increased tissue uptake of fluid and macromolecules, but reduced lymph flow toward draining lymph nodes. The reduced lymphatic pumping was linked to impaired vessel contractility, partly restored by inhibiting nitric oxide. These results reveal that caveolae in lymphatic endothelium regulate two opposing aspects: they normally limit tissue fluid uptake while supporting rhythmic lymph propulsion. The study highlights caveolae as a key regulator of lymphatic transport.",
