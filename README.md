# Nasa_Project
Project Overview

Our project is a web-based dashboard designed to make NASA’s space biology research more accessible and easier to understand. These studies provide valuable insights into how space environments affect humans, plants, and other living systems. However, the information is currently spread across many publications, making it difficult for users to quickly find what they need.

With our dashboard, we aim to bring this knowledge together in one place and present it in a clear and organized way. The platform will allow users to:

Search by keywords

Apply filters to organize results

View simple summaries and visualizations of findings

This will help scientists discover new ideas, managers identify areas for investment, and mission planners prepare for safer and more efficient Moon and Mars missions.

Target Users

Scientists and researchers seeking new insights

Managers and decision-makers exploring opportunities

Mission planners preparing for human space exploration

Planned Tech Stack

Frontend: React or basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript

Backend: Node.js or ASP.NET Core

Data: NASA open bioscience publications

Hosting: GitHub Pages or cloud platform

Team

We are a group of beginner developers with backgrounds in web development, IT, and cybersecurity. Although we are still early in our careers, we are passionate about learning, teamwork, and contributing to NASA’s Space Apps Challenge 2025.
